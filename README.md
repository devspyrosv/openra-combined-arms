### About the Snap

This is a **Snap package** for **OpenRA - Combined Arms**, a modern remake of Command & Conquer games powered by the OpenRA engine. 

Play a standalone mod with unique features, enhanced visuals, and a reimagined RTS experience.

This snap was created to provide a safer and more secure way to enjoy OpenRA - Combined Arms. By confining the game within a sandboxed environment, the snap limits its access to system resources, ensuring that it can run safely without interfering with your operating system or accessing sensitive data. This approach not only enhances security but also makes the game easier to install and run across different Linux distributions, leveraging the convenience of Snap's universal packaging format.
